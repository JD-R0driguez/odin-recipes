        <div class="par"><p>Oh, joy! It's the Coffee Buzz Martini, the perfect cocktail for those who can't decide<br> 
            whether they need a drink or a caffeine hit. This delightful concoction combines the <br>
            smooth, bitter taste of espresso with vodka, coffee liqueur, and heavy cream. Because<br>
            who needs sleep, right? And if that's not enough to make you feel alive, go ahead and<br>
            sprinkle some cocoa powder on top - because nothing screams sophistication quite like<br>
            chocolatey bits floating in your drink.</p>
        </div>
        <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 oz of your favorite brewed coffee, cooled.</li>
            <li>2 oz vodka or more (depending on how much of your day you want to forget)</li>
            <li>1 oz coffee liqueur (why not add more coffee to your coffee?)</li>
            <li>1 oz heavy cream to balance out all the caffeine</li>
            <li>Ice (just like your heart)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Instructions:</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a sip of your coffee to make sure it's strong enough to make you shake.</li>
            <li>Dump the coffee into a cocktail shaker, followed by the vodka, coffee liqueur, and heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Just shake it out, shake it out, and shake it out.</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture into a chilled martini glass, forget the glass, just drink it straight out of the shaker.</li>
            <li>Take a sip and marvel at how much more productive you're going to be for the next 30 minutes before crashing hard. Cheers!</li>
