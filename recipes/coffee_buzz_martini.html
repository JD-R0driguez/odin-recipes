            <h2>- Coffee Buzz Martini -</h2>
            <p class="description">Oh, joy! It's the Coffee Buzz Martini, the perfect cocktail for those who can't decide
                whether they need a drink or a caffeine hit. This delightful concoction combines the
                smooth, bitter taste of espresso with vodka, coffee liqueur, and heavy cream. Because
                who needs sleep, right? And if that's not enough to make you feel alive, go ahead and
                sprinkle some cocoa powder on top - because nothing screams sophistication quite like
                chocolatey bits floating in your drink.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 oz of your favorite brewed coffee, cooled.</li>
                <li>2 oz vodka or more (depending on how much of your day you want to forget)</li>
                <li>1 oz coffee liqueur (why not add more coffee to your coffee?)</li>
                <li>1 oz heavy cream to balance out all the caffeine</li>
                <li>Ice (just like your heart)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a sip of your coffee to make sure it's strong enough to make you shake.</li>
                <li>Dump the coffee into a cocktail shaker, followed by the vodka, coffee liqueur, and heavy cream.</li>
                <li>Just shake it out, shake it out, and shake it out.</li>
                <li>Strain the mixture into a chilled martini glass, forget the glass, just drink it straight out of the shaker.</li>
                <li>Take a sip and marvel at how much more productive you're going to be for the next 30 minutes before crashing hard. Cheers!</li>
