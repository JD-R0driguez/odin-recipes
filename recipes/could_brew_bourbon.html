        alt="Bold coffee meets aged whiskey. Cold brew bourbon: smooth, refreshing, irresistible.">
        <p>Oh, joy, another trendy drink: cold brew bourbon. Because regular old bourbon just<br>
            wasn't fancy enough, right? But hey, who are we to judge? It's just coffee and whiskey<br> 
            mixed together, no big deal. Except, of course, for the fact that it's bold, refreshing,<br> 
            and oh-so-smooth. Who needs boring old drinks when you can have a unique, complex<br> 
            flavor that's sure to impress all your hipster friends?</p>

            <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 oz bourbon (the good stuff, not the one you use for cleaning your tools)</li>
                <li>4 oz cold brew coffee. If it's not cold, it won't work. It's science.</li>
                <li>1 oz simple syrup</li>
                <li>Ice cubes. If you don't have any, please don't attempt to make this cocktail. Stick to drinking water.)</li>
                <li>Orange peel (optional, but it makes you look fancy)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><h2>Instructions:</h2></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Grab a glass and fill it with ice cubes.</li>
                <li>Pour the bourbon over the ice. Don't be shy, give it a good pour. You deserve it.</li>
                <li>Add the cold brew coffee and simple syrup. Mix it well.</li>
                <li>If you have an orange peel, twist it and use it as a garnish. If not, use your imagination. A carrot peel, perhaps?</li>
                <li>Then, sit back, relax, and enjoy your delicious and refreshing cold brew bourbon. Cheers!</li>
